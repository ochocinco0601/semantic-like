## ServiceNow Reports and KPIs - Semantic Documentation Wiki

### 1. Purpose and Scope
**Goal:**
This wiki serves as a centralized repository for documenting the definitions, criteria, and calculations of ServiceNow reports, KPIs, and measures. By maintaining standardized definitions, we ensure consistency, accuracy, and trust in the data across all teams.

**Scope:**
Initially, this documentation covers high-impact reports and KPIs used in ServiceNow, with a focus on:
- Incident Management
- SLA Performance
- Change Management
- Business Impact Metrics

Future expansions will incorporate additional domains and automation integration.

### 4. Business Logic & Calculation Examples

#### **First Response Time (FRT) Calculation**
- **Definition:** Measures the elapsed time from when a ticket is created until the first agent response.
- **Formula:**
  - `FRT = (First Response Timestamp - Ticket Creation Timestamp)`
- **Exclusions:**
  - Auto-generated responses are excluded.
  - Business hours considerations (if applicable) should be accounted for.
- **Example:**
  - If a ticket was created at 9:00 AM and the first response was logged at 9:30 AM, the FRT is 30 minutes.

#### **SLA Compliance Rate Calculation**
- **Definition:** The percentage of tickets resolved within the SLA-defined resolution time.
- **Formula:**
  - `SLA Compliance Rate (%) = (Number of tickets resolved within SLA / Total tickets with SLA) * 100`
- **Example:**
  - If 80 out of 100 incidents met their SLA targets, the SLA Compliance Rate is 80%.

#### **Change Approval Rate Calculation**
- **Definition:** Measures the percentage of submitted changes that received approval.
- **Formula:**
  - `Approval Rate (%) = (Number of Approved Changes / Total Submitted Changes) * 100`
- **Example:**
  - If 50 out of 70 change requests were approved, the Approval Rate is 71.4%.

### Next Steps
- **Governance:** A bi-weekly review meeting will be scheduled to validate definitions and update documentation.
- **Feedback Loop:** Users can submit recommendations and report inconsistencies using the [Feedback Form](#).
- **Expansion Plan:** Additional reports and KPIs will be incorporated based on business needs and data availability.
