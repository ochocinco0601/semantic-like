## ServiceNow reports and KPIs - semantic documentation wiki

### Purpose and scope

**Goal**
This wiki is a centralized resource for defining ServiceNow reports, KPIs, and measures. Standardized definitions ensure consistency, accuracy, and trust in data across teams.

**Scope**
This documentation initially covers high-impact reports and KPIs in ServiceNow, including:

- Incident management
- SLA performance
- Change management
- Business impact metrics

Future updates will expand to additional domains and automation integration.

### Report definitions

#### Incident overview report

- **Purpose**: Summarizes all incidents over a selected timeframe.
- **Criteria**:
  - Incident status: Open, Closed, Resolved
  - Date range: User-defined (e.g., last 30 days)
  - Group by: Assignment group, Priority
- **Key metrics**:
  - Number of incidents
  - Average resolution time
  - SLA compliance percentage
- **ServiceNow report**: [View Incident Overview Report](#)

#### SLA performance report

- **Purpose**: Tracks compliance with SLA targets for incident resolution.
- **Criteria**:
  - Incidents with defined SLAs
  - Excludes incidents pending user response
  - Calculates percentage met vs. breached
- **Key metrics**:
  - SLA compliance rate (%)
  - Average resolution time
- **ServiceNow report**: [View SLA Performance Report](#)

#### Change management report

- **Purpose**: Monitors the status and approval trends of change requests.
- **Criteria**:
  - Change type: Normal, Emergency, Standard
  - Change status: New, Approved, Rejected, Implemented

### Business logic and calculation examples

#### First response time (FRT) calculation

- **Definition**: Measures the time from ticket creation to the first agent response.
- **Formula**:
  ```plaintext
  FRT = First response timestamp - Ticket creation timestamp
  ```
- **Exclusions**:
  - Auto-generated responses are excluded.
  - Business hours considerations apply, if applicable.
- **Example**:
  - A ticket is created at 9:00 AM, and the first response is logged at 9:30 AM. The FRT is 30 minutes.

#### SLA compliance rate calculation

- **Definition**: The percentage of tickets resolved within the SLA-defined resolution time.
- **Formula**:
  ```plaintext
  SLA Compliance Rate (%) = (Tickets resolved within SLA / Total tickets with SLA) * 100
  ```
- **Example**:
  - If 80 out of 100 incidents met their SLA targets, the SLA compliance rate is 80%.

#### Change approval rate calculation

- **Definition**: Measures the percentage of submitted changes that received approval.
- **Formula**:
  ```plaintext
  Approval Rate (%) = (Approved changes / Total submitted changes) * 100
  ```
- **Example**:
  - If 50 out of 70 change requests were approved, the approval rate is 71.4%.

### Next steps

- **Governance**: A bi-weekly review will validate definitions and update documentation.
- **Feedback loop**: Submit recommendations and report inconsistencies using the [feedback form](#).
- **Expansion plan**: Additional reports and KPIs will be documented based on business needs and data availability.
